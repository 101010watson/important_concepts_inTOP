# Multiple classes

 ## this is my understanding
 ohh okay i seem to get it its that the .alert-text css properties is almost applied in all the elements hence the base class then on top of that info or warning classes are added why? because the user wants to have the properties of base class and also the properties of new class and this is done via multiple classes to the single element so that it follows the DRY concept 

 ## this is claude AI
 You've got it! Almost perfect understanding.
What you nailed:

Base class (.alert-text) provides shared styles
Additional classes add specific features on top
Multiple classes let you combine features
This follows DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

One small refinement to your thinking:
You said "because the user wants to have the properties of base class AND the properties of new class."
It's not just that the user wants this - it's that this is good software design. You're separating concerns:

What it is (an alert) = .alert-text
How severe it is (info/warning/severe) = .info/.warning/.severe-alert
How big it is (large/small) = .large/.small

Why this matters:
If you later decide all alerts need different padding, you change ONE place (.alert-text). If you decide severe alerts need blinking text, you change ONE place (.severe-alert).
Your understanding is solid: Multiple classes = composable, reusable pieces that combine to create the final styling, following DRY principles.
You've grasped the core concept correctly. This same pattern shows up everywhere in CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, and good custom CSS architectures.
